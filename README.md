# WiseEye-Elderly-Monitoring-System

—The Wise Eye Elderly Monitoring System, a 
comprehensive solution for the monitoring and care of elderly 
people in Sri Lanka, was developed and put into use as part of 
this study. This system includes monitoring devices and mobile 
application to reduce the burden on caregivers. The system 
uses machine learning techniques to enable automatic system 
activation and deactivation through image classification, 
assuring user-friendliness and individualized monitoring for 
each senior. The device also has an automatic accident 
detection module that uses machine learning techniques to find 
accidents in real time and identify them, alerting carers who 
are away from home right immediately by mobile app. 
Additionally, the system incorporates voice and sound 
recognition algorithms to improve communication and enable 
voice-based commands. This functionality will enhance the 
system’s ability to seamlessly identify and classify an incident 
of emergency based on the voice inputs received. At the very 
least, the Wise Eye system uses behavioral pattern analysis and 
machine learning to forecast how active an older person will 
be, providing details on their daily routines and probable 
behavioral aberrations. A dataset of real-world scenarios is 
used to evaluate the system, showing how well it can recognize 
the elderly, detect accidents, hear spoken commands, and 
gauge activity levels. The suggested Wise Eye Older 
Monitoring System offers a clever and thorough solution that 
increases the older population's safety and well-being while 
simultaneously lightening the load on caregivers and raising 
the standard of care delivered.
